To translate, make a copy of en\Example Language File.po, and replace what is inside msgstr "" with a translation of what is in msgid "".
Then save it in the appropriate directory as mentioned below, or for testing, replace en\EScribe.po with it. Then restart EScribe to test.

You can test your translation by going to Help->About, left clicking seven times on the Evolv logo, and then going to Tools->Open Languages Folder.
This opens the folder containing all the translation files. Put yours in the appropriate subdirectory.

EScribe will first look for EScribe.po in the subdirectory of your system language and region, for example, en-US\EScribe.po or it-IT\EScribe.po or zh-Hans\EScribe.po.
If it does not find this, it will look in the subdirectory of your system language, for example, en\EScribe.po or or it\EScribe.po or zh\EScribe.po.
If it does not find this either, it will default to the English text.

Thank you!
